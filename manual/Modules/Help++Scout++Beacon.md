This module integrates a Help Scout beacon in your Ride backend.

More details on beacons, their funcionality and possible customization can be found [here (Help Scout developer portal)](http://developer.helpscout.net/beacons/).

The module requires that the `helpscout.beacon.form.id` parameter is set, otherwise it won't do anything. 
The form id is your key which can be found in your [Help Scout Dashboard](https://secure.helpscout.net/settings/beacons/).
